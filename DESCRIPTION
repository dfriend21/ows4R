Description: Provides an Interface to Web-Services defined as standards by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), including Web Feature Service
 (WFS) for vector data, Web Coverage Service (WCS), Catalogue Service (CSW) for ISO/OGC metadata, and associated standards such as the common 
 web-service specification (OWS) and OGC Filter Encoding. Partial support is provided for the Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Processing Service (WPS). 
 The purpose is to add support for additional OGC service standards such as Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) or OGC API.
